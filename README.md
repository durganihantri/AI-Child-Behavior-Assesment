Multimodal AI-powered tool for analyzing child emotions and speech patterns

🚀 Live Demo: Hugging Face Spaces

📌 Overview

The AI Child Behavior Assessment app is designed to analyze children’s emotional and speech patterns using multimodal AI models. It integrates:
	•	Facial Emotion Recognition (DeepFace) 🧑‍🎨
	•	Speech Analysis & Transcription (Wav2Vec2) 🎙️
	•	Multimodal Analysis (Video + Audio combined) 🎥 + 🔊

This tool helps in early mental health screening and behavioral assessments for research, caregivers, and psychologists.
